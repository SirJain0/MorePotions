## General Info

This mod adds potions to Wither in Minecraft, coming in its regular form along with the lingering potions, splash potions, and tipped arrows!

There are three types of default Wither potions, which are also available in the creative tab:
- Regular potion: Wither I for 16 seconds
- Long variant: Wither I for 36 seconds
- Strong variant: Wither II for 10 seconds

## More Details

You can make a regular potion of Wither using Withered ashes Awkward potion. To obtain Withered ashes, you have to kill Wither skeletons. To elongate the duration of the potion, combine it with redstone, and to make it stronger, combine the elongated potion with glowstone. To convert the potions to splash potions, add gunpowder, and to convert to lingering, add dragon's breath.

Note: This mod requires Fabric API.
